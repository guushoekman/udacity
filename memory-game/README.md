# Memory Game Project

## Table of Contents

This project was made as part of the Udacity front-end nanodegree.

## Instructions

A simple memory game. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. Click on a card to flip it over and try to find the second card with that symbol. Win the game by finding all the pairs. You can restart the game by clicking on the restart icon: ![restart icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guushoekman/udacity/master/memory-game/img/restart.png).

After you win, you'll see how long it took you (moves and time) and give you a chance to start again.
